    question: "What is Visagism?",
    answer:
      "Visagism is a modern approach to smile design that blends art and science. It studies your facial features, expressions, and personality to create a smile that naturally fits you, not a generic template. It’s what makes every result unique, authentic, and in harmony with your identity.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How long will my new smile last and how should I care for it?",
    answer:
      "With professional care and good habits, high-quality veneers can last over a decade. You should continue brushing twice daily, flossing, attending regular check-ups, and avoiding using your teeth as tools or biting very hard objects.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Am I a good candidate for a smile makeover with Visagism?",
    answer:
      "Most adult patients who have healthy teeth and gums, and who want a more confident, natural smile, are good candidates. During your consultation, we’ll assess your oral health, smile goals, and facial features to create a customised plan. If there are active issues like decay or gum disease, we’ll treat those first.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Does the procedure hurt or require a long recovery?",
    answer:
      "No. The process is designed to be comfortable. We use local anaesthetic during preparation and many patients feel little to no discomfort. Some mild sensitivity may occur afterward, but this usually resolves within days.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Will my smile look natural or “too perfect”?",
    answer:
      "Yes, that’s the promise of our Visagism-based design. We align your smile with your facial structure, personality, and features so it looks and feels uniquely yours, not like a template. Colour, shape and texture are carefully matched for authenticity.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What is the process & how many visits will I need?",
    answer:
      "The process typically starts with a consultation and 3D assessment of your face and smile. After design approval, we prepare the teeth, take impressions, and place the veneers. Most full-mouth transformations take 4–8 weeks, depending on your plan and any preparatory work. A shorter case (2-4 teeth) could be faster.",
